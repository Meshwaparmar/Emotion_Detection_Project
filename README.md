# Emotion_Detection_Project
Developed a Facial Emotion Recognition system using Deep Learning to classify human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, etc. The model processes real-time or static images to detect and analyze facial expressions. Technologies Used: Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) Dataset: FER-2013 Preprocessing: Image augmentation, grayscale conversion, face detection using Haar cascades Key Contributions: Built and trained a CNN model to classify emotions with high accuracy Implemented real-time emotion detection using OpenCV Optimized model performance through data augmentation and hyperparameter tuning Outcome: Achieved an accuracy of 64% and successfully implemented for real-time facial emotion analysis.
